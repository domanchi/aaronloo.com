There isn't an easy way to create arrays in Liquid.
https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid/basics/types#initializing-arrays

However, unless we want to use Jekyll's front matter (or site variables) to
store all the configurations for each progress bar, and pass it down through
the stack, we'll just have to use split to handle it.
